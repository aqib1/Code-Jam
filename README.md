# Code-Jam
This repository is created for the solutions for code-jam i recently start practicing 

The sources are in Java code, and each source file contains a description of the algorithm used. The Java packages in the src directory contain source code grouped by Code Jam edition and round.

The resources directory contains input datasets, outputs and other support files. Since Code Jam 2018 dataset files are no longer provided, thus what is included here is what I assembled from the provided examples and my own test cases.

Each class provided have time and space complexity required to solve problem, Some of problem have brute force improvised versions then also imporved versions. This reporsitory is in earlier stange.

Eclipse is my favorite IDE, so i created my soultion there, you can run those on any IDE you like :)

## Code Jam 2020
 - Qualification round:
   - **Vestigium** trivial O(n*n) solution scanning rows and columns for duplicates
   - **NestingDepth** linear solution O(n) with simple math hack
